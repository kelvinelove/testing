Note: I was unable to complete this project during the interview due to some package installation errors (the network was down for most of the exam). I could not even install the basic requirements of the project. However, as per the advice of the invigilating team (Mandhla), I just wrote the code as is to showcase what I was trying to achieve

Please review the code. If possible, I would love to retake the examination when the network is stable.
