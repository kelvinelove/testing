# Countries Login App

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app` by Kelvin Chawora.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## NOTE


Note: I was unable to complete this project during the interview due to some package installation errors (the network was down for most of the exam). I could not even install the basic requirements of the project. However, as per the advice of the invigilating team (Mandhla), I just wrote the code as is to showcase what I was trying to achieve. When it worked, it was haning up and I couldn't even push my code:

Please review the code. If possible, I would love to retake the examination when the network is stable.

I also used an open source third party API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to fetch all the countries
